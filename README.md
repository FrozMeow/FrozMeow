# 👋 Hello,I'm FrozMeow (this is so cringe)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **newbie developer** learning **Python** 🐍 and **JavaScript** ☕. I love exploring how to build cool things that can _send something_ — data, messages, or even good vibes! 🌟

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

- **Python**: Automating tasks, building scripts, and exploring web frameworks like Flask and Django.
- **JavaScript**: Making web pages interactive using vanilla JS and frameworks like React.
- **APIs**: Sending and receiving data, because I love connecting things together!

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Here are some of the tools I’m working with or exploring:

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and maybe React soon!)
- **Backend**: Flask, Node.js (coming soon!)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Other Interests**: APIs, automation, and learning by doing!
